Because you could have the dope cousin in reality in when you make a PN junction the dope and most likely it's hard to change immediately. Let's say at zero to change from NA 2 ND abruptly would be more like gradual. So for example in the textbook you'll see this called graded PN Junction. Things like that. But here will assume the doping is uniform and abrupt. This this step junction the other assumption. Two is non degenerate.
