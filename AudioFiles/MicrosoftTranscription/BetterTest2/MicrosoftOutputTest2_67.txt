So if that's the case, that it means you're not at steady state. We didn't reach steady state. If you assume steady state, it means that the current, so the current is constant everywhere. The other way is simple. I mean whatever carriers coming in from the P region from the left hand side, they should come out from the other side. So this current should be equal. Otherwise if they're not equal, where does the difference goal? OK, I don't have any other path. You see, she's not like a transistor or there's no other third terminal.
