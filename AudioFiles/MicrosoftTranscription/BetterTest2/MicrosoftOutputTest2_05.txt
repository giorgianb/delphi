Reverse bias, we're applying a pause to voltage to the not exactly positive by replying a higher voltage to the end region compared to the P region. So what happens is because that's a voltage, but if you look at the energy band diagram, its energy. So basically there is a minus sign because electrons have negative charge and we saw before. For example, if you look at the energy band diagram, look at EC to get the voltage you flip EC and if you remember that's because of the minus sign my.
