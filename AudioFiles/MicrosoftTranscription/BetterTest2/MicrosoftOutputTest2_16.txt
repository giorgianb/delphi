We are not interested in that. We're interested in finding this. I know the electric field is maximum at zero. I want to find that peak electric field so then I can use either expression minus Ena over epsilon XP or the other one. You will get the same answer and then you just substitute the expression. OK. So here I think, let me see. So here it doesn't matter. For example, let's pick the first 1 -- E Na over epsilon XP.
